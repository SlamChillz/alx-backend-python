# Python - Async Comprehension

The learning objectives of this project are:
- How to write an asynchronous generator
- How to use async comprehensions
- How to type-annotate generators

## 0. Async Generator

Write a coroutine called `async_generator` that takes no arguments.

The coroutine will loop 10 times, each time asynchronously wait 1 second, then yield a random number between 0 and 10. Use the `random` module. 

## 1. Async Comprehensions

Import `async_generator` from the previous task and then write a coroutine called `async_comprehension` that takes no arguments.

The coroutine will collect 10 random numbers using an async comprehensing over `async_generator`, then return the 10 random numbers.

## 2. Run time for four parallel comprehensions

Import `async_comprehension` from the previous file and write a `measure_runtime` coroutine that will execute `async_comprehension` four times in parallel using `asyncio.gather`.

`measure_runtime` should measure the total runtime and return it.

Notice that the total runtime is roughly 10 seconds, explain it to yourself.
